description = [[Maj'Eyal contains an uncountable number of underground caverns, structures, and tunnel systems. Some spaces are, of course, inhabited, long gone from the eyes of those living aboveground...
The Supplicants have arrived! Under the guidance of a sentient artifact named as "The One," Supplicants sacrifice life and limb to uphold the tenements of "The One."
Their sacrifices don't go unnoticed; "The One" grants its aura-marking and aura-manipulating abilities to those faithful to the cause of upholding balance within Maj'Eyal.

Aura, to those who can perceive it, appears as a gloopy, constantly-shifting substance. It is only visible around sentient beings, and is otherwise useless...except for the Supplicants.

Introduces two new classes:
- The Phantasm: Masters of self-manipulation, Apperceived can shift auratic substance towards certain points of their body, allowing for unbelievable physical feats.
Some Apperceived are even capable of turning the auras of others against them, with devestating results.
This sheer mastery over auric manipulation comes at the cost of all other disciplines; Apperceived can only wear the lightest of armor and are otherwise unarmed.]]
